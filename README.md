This repository contains the files for my professional coding portfolio.


## Description
This is the professional software engineering portfolio of Daniel Thomas Klotz. This is where I would like to demonstrate the skills that I have learned, and facilitate the exchange of contact information to assist me in my search for a job as a software developer.

You can find the deployed website at: https://dan-klo.github.io/danielk-portfolio/.

You can find the GitHub repository at: https://github.com/Dan-Klo/danielk-portfolio.

## Features in Development
I will continue to add to this portfolio website, and as I develop new skills and projects the site will be updated to reflect that.

My future efforts will be focused on:

  Replacing the placeholder images with screenshots and links to real deployed projects.

  Refine the general layout and appearance.

  Make the contact form functional.

I would also like to add a small section about my personal interests to give the reader a better sense of who I am as a person beyond software development. I am looking forward to seeing how my portfolio evolves as I continue to learn.

Thanks for looking!
Daniel Thomas Klotz
