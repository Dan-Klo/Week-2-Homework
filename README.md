This repository contains the files for my professional coding portfolio.


## Description
This is the professional software engineering portfolio of Daniel Thomas Klotz. This is where I would like to demonstrate the skills that I have learned, and facilitate the exchange of contact information to assist me in my search for a job as a software developer.

You can find the deployed website at: https://dan-klo.github.io/danielk-portfolio/.

You can find the GitHub repository at: https://github.com/Dan-Klo/danielk-portfolio.

## Features in Development
I will continue to add to this portfolio website, and as I develop new skills and projects the site will be updated to reflect that.

My efforts will be focused on replacing the placeholder images with screenshots and links to real deployed projects.

After that I will refine its layout and appearance.

I am looking forward to seeing how my portfolio evolves as I continue to learn.

Thanks for looking!
Daniel
